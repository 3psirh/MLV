Comand|Example                             |Description
------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------
   -u |Example (-u https://google.com)                     |link  
   -v |Example (-v 1000)                                   |views
   -p |Example (-p http(s)/15.15.15.15:15                  |proxy(if you want to use)
   -th|Example (-th 20)                                    |threads. If you don't want to change, just write at the end of the command. The number of threads will be the number of cores your processor
 -txtp|Example (-txtp)                                     |write your proxy form the txt file(if you want to use)
   
**Full Example:**
-u http://google.com -v 4000 -p https/1.2.13:37 `or` -txtp proxy.txt -th 10

What you should write in proxy.txt, for MLV could read it:

1. http;12.12.12.12:13
2. https;1.1.1.1:84



_P.S. Don't use -txtp with -th because -th creates an impression of the cheating views_
